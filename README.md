# react-native-location-capture #

A native module for [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
that lets you capture the user's location, either on demand or periodically in
the background, even while the phone is asleep.  When running in background
mode, the captured locations are stored in an SQLite database, and can
optionally be uploaded to a remote server.
